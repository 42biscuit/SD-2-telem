## Todo  (When a task is done tick off and Will be deleted at the next Telemetry meeting)
- [ ] Write tests for data loading
- [ ] Update file loading for new file format
- [ ] Get Git upto date
- [ ] Finish README
- [ ] Make current program adhear to syntax rules
- [ ] go over Struct system
- [ ] decide on library for python plotting


## Project Programming Methodology
- Give all variables concise descriptive names
- For all functions handeling or manipulating data imagin the function is a black box, what are the ouputs you could expect for given inputs. What are errenous inputs, how will the function handel them. Write tests for these before you write the function
- Follow the DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself) Principal
- Write documentation as you go + concise comments. If you came back in 6 months would you be able to find how the function works.
- If you have questions about using the Git drop someone a message.
